The Airwallex iOS SDK is a framework for integrating easy, fast and secure payments inside your app with Airwallex.

## Requirements
The Airwallex iOS SDK requires Xcode 9.3 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 10 or above.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'Airwallex'
```

### Carthage

## Swift

Even though `Airwallex` is written in Objective-C, it can be used in Swift with no hassle. If you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org),  add the following line to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html):

```ruby

```

## Usage

### Initialize Airwallex SDK

The specific base URL can be set in an instance of `Airwallex`.

```
[Airwallex setDefaultBaseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"Airwallex payment base URL"]];
```

### Using `AWAPIClient`

Please set client secret before using `AWAPIClient` to send a request.

```
[AWAPIClientConfiguration sharedConfiguration].clientSecret = "The client secret merchant provides";
AWAPIClient *client = [[AWAPIClient alloc] initWithConfiguration:[AWAPIClientConfiguration sharedConfiguration]];
```

### Examples

There is an example app included in the repository and it provides the way how to check out with WeChat SDK.
