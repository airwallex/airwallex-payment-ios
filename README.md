The Airwallex iOS SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent payment experience in your iOS app. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your usersâ€™ payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

Get started with our integration guide and example project.

## Features

**Simplified Security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers. This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Airwallex instead of passing through your server.

**WeChat Pay**: We provide a seamless integration with WeChat Pay.

**3DS**: The SDK automatically performs native 3D Secure authentication if needed.

**Airwallex API**: We provide low-level APIs that correspond to objects and methods in the Airwallex API. You can build your own entirely custom UI on top of this layer, while still taking advantage of utilities like `AWCardValidator` to validate your userâ€™s input.

**Native UI**: We provide native screens to collect payment and shipping details. For example, `AWCardViewController` is a UIViewController that collects, validates card details and finishes saving.

You can use these individually, or take all of the prebuilt UI in one flow by following the Basic Integration guide.

From let to right: `AWCardViewController`, `AWPaymentMethodListViewController`, `AWEditShippingViewController`, `AWPaymentViewController`

## Releases

Otherwise, the instructions and example code may be mismatched with your copy. You can read the latest tagged version of this README and browse the associated code on GitHub.

## Requirements
The Airwallex iOS SDK requires Xcode 10.0 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 10 or above.
