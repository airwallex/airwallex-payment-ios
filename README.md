The Airwallex iOS SDK is a framework for integrating easy, fast and secure payments inside your app with Airwallex. It provides simple functions to send sensitive credit card data directly to Airwallex, it also provides a powerful, customizable interface for collecting user payment details.

## Requirements
The Airwallex iOS SDK requires Xcode 10 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 10 or above.

```ruby
pod 'Airwallex'
```

configuration.intentId = "Payment intent ID";
configuration.clientSecret = "Client secret";
configuration.currency = "Your currency";
configuration.customerId = "Your customer ID";
```
