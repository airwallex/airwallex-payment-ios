> [!TIP] 
> Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [migration guide](MIGRATION.md)

## Requirements
- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 15.4+ (For older Xcode versions, refer to release 5.4.3)

## Examples

The Examples can be run on the latest Xcode. To run the example app, you should follow these steps.

- Clone source code

```
git clone git@github.com:airwallex/airwallex-payment-ios.git
```

- Install dependencies and open project

Make sure you have installed Cocoapods and then run the following command in the project directory:

```
pod install
```

> [!TIP] 
> Update key file (Optional)
>- In the `Examples/Keys` folder, edit `Keys.json` with proper keys.
>- Build and run `Examples` schema
>
> The key file provides default values for settings. You can update these settings anytime using the in-app settings screen.

## Integration

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager
Airwallex for iOS is available via Swift Package Manager. To integrate it into your project, follow these steps:
1. Follow [Apple's guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) on how to add a package dependency in Xcode.

2. Use the following URL for the Airwallex package:
https://github.com/airwallex/airwallex-payment-ios

3. Ensure you specify version 6.1.1 or later.

You can add `Airwallex` for a comprehensive integration that includes everything except WeChat Pay. Alternatively, you can selectively add specific products to your project for a more modular setup, depending on your payment needs:

- `AirwallexPaymentSheet`: For UI integration. 
- `AirwallexPayment`: For low-level API integration.
- `AirwallexWeChatPay`: Required for WeChat Pay integration.

**Size Impact**

| Integration Style| Components Included | IPA Size Increase |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------:|
| Low-Level API Integration | AirwallexCore <br> AirwallexPayment | 428KB  |
| UI Integration | AirwallexCore  <br> AirwallexPayment <br> AirwallexPaymentSheet | 1.2 MB |
| Full Integration | AirwallexCore  <br> AirwallexPayment  <br> AirwallexPaymentSheet  <br> AirwallexWeChatPay | 1.4 MB |

> The above size increase (compressed) was calculated based on Xcode’s App Thinning Size Report for a minimal iOS project integrating AirwallexSDK via Swift Package Manager (SPM).
#### CocoaPods

Airwallex for iOS is available via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

You can add `Airwallex` for a comprehensive integration that includes everything except WeChat Pay:
```ruby
pod 'Airwallex', '~> 6.1.1'
```

Alternatively, you can selectively add specific products to your project for a more modular setup, depending on your payment needs:
```ruby
pod 'Airwallex/AirwallexPaymentSheet' # For UI integration. 
pod 'Airwallex/AirwallexPayment' # For low-level API integration
pod 'Airwallex/AirwallexWeChatPay' # Required for WeChat Pay integration
```

Run the following command:
```ruby
pod install
```

### Required Setup

When your app starts, configure the SDK with `mode`.

``` swift
Airwallex.setMode(.demoMode) // .demoMode, .stagingMode, .productionMode
```
---
#### Customer ID 

Generate or retrieve a customer ID for your user on your server-side. 
Refer to the [Airwallex API Doc](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api#/Payment_Acceptance/Customers/) for more details

> [!NOTE]
> If you only support guest checkout, you can skip this step
---
#### Payment Intent

The Payment Intent is a required object for all transaction modes in the Airwallex iOS SDK. 
It represents a specific payment attempt and must be created before initiating a payment from the mobile app.
Create payment intent on your **server-side** and then pass the payment intent to the mobile-side to confirm the payment intent with the payment method selected.

Please refer to the [Airwallex API Doc](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api#/Payment_Acceptance/Payment_Intents/) for details of the payment intent API.

While creating payment intent using `payment_intents/create`:
- If **amount = 0**, only a payment consent will be created (no funds will be deducted).
- If **amount > 0**, a payment consent will be created and a deduction will be made at the same time.
- For guest checkout, `customer_id` parameter can be omitted.

---
#### Client Secret

Update client secret using `paymentIntent.clientSecret`
``` swift
AWXAPIClientConfiguration.shared().clientSecret = paymentIntent.clientSecret
```
---
#### Payment session

``` swift
let paymentConsentOptions = if /* one-off transaction */  {
    nil
} else {
    /* recurring transaction */
    PaymentConsentOptions(
        nextTriggeredBy: ".customer/.merchant",
        merchantTriggerReason: "nil/.scheduled/.unscheduled/...."
    )
}
let session = Session(
    paymentIntent: "payment intent create on your server",
    countryCode: "Your country code",
    applePayOptions: "required if you want to support apple pay",
    autoCapture: "Only applicable when for card payment. If true the payment will be captured immediately after authorization succeeds.",
    billing: "prefilled billing address",
    paymentConsentOptions: "info for recurring transactions",
    requiredBillingContactFields: "customize billing contact fields for card payment",
    returnURL: "App return url"
)
```
The new [Session](https://weiping-awx.github.io/airwallex-payment-ios/6.1.9/documentation/airwallex/session) type introduced in version 6.2.0 provides a unified and simplified way for integration and there are some internal optimization as well. We recommend using `Session` instead of the legacy `AWXOneOffSession`, `AWXRecurringSession`, and `AWXRecurringWithIntentSession`.

> [!NOTE]
> We will continue to support integrations using legacy session types until the next major version release. For integration steps, please refer to [integration guide](https://github.com/airwallex/airwallex-payment-ios/tree/6.1.9?tab=readme-ov-file#integration)

A -- paymentConsentOptions != nil --> B2

subgraph Legacy Sessions
    B1;C1;C2
end

B2 -- amount \> 0 --> C2
```

### Optional Setup
---
#### WeChat Pay
- make sure you add dependency for `AirwallexWeChatPay` (Swift package manager) or `Airwallex/AirwallexWechatPay` (Cocoapods)
- setup `WechatOpenSDK` following the [Wechat document](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/en/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html)

``` swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        WXApi.registerApp("WeChat app ID", universalLink: "universal link of your app")
        return true
    }
    
    func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        return WXApi.handleOpen(url, delegate: self)
    }
}

extension AppDelegate: WXApiDelegate {
    func onResp(_ resp: BaseResp) {
        if let response = resp as? PayResp {
            switch response.errCode {
                // handle payment result
            }
        }
    }
}
```
After completing payment, WeChat will be redirected to the merchant's app and do a callback using `onResp()`, then it can retrieve the payment intent status after the merchant server is notified, so please keep listening to the notification.
  
> [!NOTE]
> We use internal dynamic framework `WechatOpenSDKDynamic.xcframework` for WeChat Pay integration.
> which is a dynamic framework build from original `WechatOpenSDK.xcframework`  2.0.4.
> By doing this, we can
> 1. Remove unsafe flag `-ObjC`, `-all_load` from SPM target `AirwallexWeChatPay`
> 2. Stripe architecture `armv7` and `i386` which is no longer needed for modern apps.

---
#### Apple Pay

The Airwallex iOS SDK allows merchants to provide Apple Pay as a payment method to their customers. 

- Make sure Apple Pay is set up correctly in the app. 
  - For more information, refer to [Apple's official doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/setting_up_apple_pay).
- Make sure Apple Pay is enabled on your Airwallex account.
- Prepare the [Merchant Identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/apple_pay/setting_up_apple_pay) and configure `applePayOptions` on the payment session object.

You can customize the Apple Pay options to restrict it as well as provide extra context. For more information, please refer to the `AWXApplePayOptions.h` header file.
```swift
let options = AWXApplePayOptions(merchantIdentifier: applePayMerchantId)
options.additionalPaymentSummaryItems = [
    .init(label: "goods", amount: 10),
    .init(label: "tax", amount: 1)
]
options.merchantCapabilities = [.threeDSecure, .debit]
options.requiredBillingContactFields = [.postalAddress]
options.supportedCountries = ["AU"]
options.totalPriceLabel = "COMPANY, INC."

let session = Session(
    //  ...
    applePayOptions: options// required for Apple Pay
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be aware that we currently support the following payment networks for Apple Pay:
>- Visa
>- MasterCard
>- ChinaUnionPay
>- Maestro
>- Amex
>- Discover
>- JCB
>
> Coupon is also not supported at this stage.


### UI Integration

#### Launch Payment Sheet (Recommended)
> [!NOTE]
> This is **recommended usage**, it builds a complete user flow on top of your app with our prebuilt UI to collect payment details, billing details, and confirming the payment.

Make sure you add dependency for `Airwallex` or `AirwallexPaymentSheet`.
Upon checkout, use [AWXUIContext](https://weiping-awx.github.io/airwallex-payment-ios/6.1.9/documentation/airwallex/awxuicontext) to present the payment flow where the user will be able to select the payment method.

``` swift
AWXUIContext.launchPayment(
    from: "hosting view controller which also handles AWXPaymentResultDelegate",
    session: "The session created above",
    filterBy: "An optional array of payment method names used to filter the payment methods returned by the server",
    launchStyle: ".push/.present",
    layout: ".tab/.accordion"
)
```

We provide `tab` and `accordian` styles for our payment sheet:

</p>

---
#### Launch Card Payment Directly
```swift
AWXUIContext.launchCardPayment(
    from: "hosting view controller which also handles AWXPaymentResultDelegate",
    session: "The session created above",
    supportedBrands: "accepted card brands, should not be empty"
)
```

> [!Tip]
> If you want to show card payment only but still want to be able to pay with saved cards, you can launch
> payment sheet by passing `[AWXCardKey]` as parameter of `filterBy:`
``` swift
AWXUIContext.launchPayment(
    from: "hosting view controller which also handles AWXPaymentResultDelegate",
    session: "The session created above",
    filterBy: [AWXCardKey]
)
```
---
#### Launch Payment Method by Name
```swift
AWXUIContext.launchPayment(
    name: "payment method name",
    from: "hosting view controller",
    session: "The session created above",
    paymentResultDelegate: "object handles AWXPaymentResultDelegate"
)
```
> [!TIP]
> Available payment method names can be found in [Airwallex API doc](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api#/Payment_Acceptance/Config/_api_v1_pa_config_payment_method_types/get)  
> 
---
#### Customize Theme Color (optional)

You can customize theme color of the payment sheet
``` swift
AWXTheme.shared().tintColor = .red
```

### Low-level API Integration

Make sure you add dependency for `Airwallex` or `AirwallexPayment`.
You can build your own entirely custom UI on top of our low-level APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> You still need all required steps listed in [Required Setup](#required-setup) section above to set up configurations, payment intent and payment session.
> 
> you may find [Airwallex API Docs](https://www.airwallex.com/docs/api#/Payment_Acceptance) useful if you are using this integration style
---
#### Create PaymentSessionHandler 
[PaymentSessionHandler](https://weiping-awx.github.io/airwallex-payment-ios/6.1.9/documentation/airwallex/paymentsessionhandler) is at the center of the API integration.
```swift
let paymentSessionHandler = PaymentSessionHandler(
    session: "The session created above", 
    viewController: "hosting view controller which also handles AWXPaymentResultDelegate"
)
// store the `paymentSessionHandler` in your view controller or class that is tied to your view's lifecycle
self.paymentSessionHandler = paymentSessionHandler
```
---
#### Pay with card
```swift
// Confirm intent with card and billing
paymentSessionHandler.startCardPayment(
    with: "The AWXCard object collected by your custom UI",
    billing: "The AWXPlaceDetails object collected by your custom UI"
)
```
---
#### Pay with saved card (consent)

- Pay with consent object - Confirm intent with a payment consent object `AWXPaymentConsent`)
``` swift
paymentSessionHandler.startConsentPayment(with: "payment consent")
```

- Pay with consent ID - Confirm intent with a valid payment consent ID only when the card is save as **network token**
``` swift
paymentSessionHandler.startConsentPayment(withId: "consent ID")
```
---
#### Pay with Apple Pay
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have [Set Up Apple Pay](#Apple-Pay) correctly.
``` swift
paymentSessionHandler.startApplePay()
```
---
#### Pay with Redirect
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> You should provide all required fields defined in "/api/v1/pa/config/payment_method_types/${payment method name}" in `additionalInfo`
``` swift
paymentSessionHandler.startRedirectPayment(
    with: "payment method name",
    additionalInfo: "all required information"
)
```

### Handle Payment Result

Regardless of what kind of integration style you choose, you need to handle the payment result in the callback of `AWXPaymentResultDelegate`.
``` swift
func paymentViewController(_ controller: UIViewController?, didCompleteWith status: AirwallexPaymentStatus, error: Error?) {
    // call back for status success/in progress/ failure / cancel
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If the payment consent is created during payment process, you can implement this optional function to get the ID of this payment consent for any further usage.
```swift
func paymentViewController(_ controller: UIViewController?, didCompleteWithPaymentConsentId paymentConsentId: String) {
    // To do anything with this ID.
}
```
